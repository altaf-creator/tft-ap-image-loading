some features in this sketch that have been developped and works:
* ESP32 as AP
* web server that serves an html file that allows uploading images
* upload handler that writes the uploaded image from a client to a file
* bitmap loader to RAM from file
* TFT draw image

i attempted to create a clock, but failed miserably.
